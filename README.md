# Stock trader

This is the final project of a fantastic Vuejs course available Udemy ([link](https://www.udemy.com/vuejs-2-the-complete-guide/learn/v4/content)). However, instead of using Google Firebase, as presented during the course, this project is using a Rails 5 back-end.

### Run in development
```
rails s
./bin/webpacker-dev-server
```

### Command history
```
rails new stock-trader --webpack=vue
```

### Notes
- Should `--skip-turbolinks` be used when creating project?
